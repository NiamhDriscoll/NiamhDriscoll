Hello there! These are the things I just coded and what I want to code soon.

Recently coded: 
- The Python script for giving you the a reminder to take your medication in my new program [MedKit](https://github.com/NiamhDriscoll/MedKit)

What I want to code soon:
- A GUI for it so users do not have to stick to the command line

Soon I will release a new project, just need to fine tune it.

Have a great day!
