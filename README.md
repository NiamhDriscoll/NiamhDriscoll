Hello there! These are the things I just coded, what I want to code sooner, and what I want sometime when I am finished with the rest of my projects 

Recently coded: 
- The Python script for giving you the a reminder to take your medication in my new program [MedKit](https://github.com/NiamhDriscoll/MedKit)

What I want to code soon:
- A GUI for it so users do not have to stick to the command line
